                        <h5 class="text-white">Most people are aware of the precarious state of the planet as we forge into the 21st Century: forest fires tearing across parched landscapes, houses destroyed by flooding, and record after record broken as summer temperatures soar. Today, the world largely understands the problems and increasingly appreciates the need for solutions to the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and rising social inequality. This awareness evokes fear, panic and perhaps hope in all of us.</h5><br>
                        <h5 class="text-white">But what about the people on the ‘front lines’ of environmental research: those who produce and translate knowledge and evidence to help us make the best decisions when dealing with environmental crises? They are painfully aware of humanity’s precarious situation and have made it their life’s work to make things better. How, then, do they feel about the state of the planet? Did they ever imagine things would be this way today? What do they fear or hope the future holds for us and our descendants?</h5><br>
                        <h5 class="text-white">This project explores the emotional connections that science researchers and communicators have with the planet and their work to preserve it. Through in-depth conversations and a co-design process influenced by social science methods, these frontline workers in the global fight against environmental crises have chosen three adjectives to describe their feelings as they stand on the brink, and have selected their own images that they feel capture these words.</h5><br>
                        <h5 class="text-white">You are seeing them. Their fears. Their hopes.</h5><br>
                        <h5 class="text-white">May this not be in vain.</h5><br>

                        She tells me about the recent bad flooding in Brazil, “It’s getting more and more frequent – so many people have lost their homes, their belongings, their lives. This makes me feel really anxious”. Although she works with environmental issues, she explains that sometimes she feels that there’s not much more she can do. “That makes me even more anxious”.</div>

                        “Every time I go to the forest, it’s a privilege for me – being there, I feel inspired”, she explains. “I’m so grateful for nature to offer me that moment. I love forests, for me it’s one of the best places to be”. She says she will fight to protect everything – “forests, rivers, oceans. I want people to feel what I feel when I’m in contact with nature. I will do my part to commit myself to spreading actions and words to protect nature more and more”.</div>

                        “Everything I read now is another record broken, another disaster, seeing something we never thought we would see in the near future.

                        This is not where he thought we would be now - we should have done more. He explains that it was clear to him that things were bad when he was younger, and that pushed him to work in conservation so he could make a difference. People know more now, he says, but it feels like little has changed. “When you’re up against capitalism and public and political inertia it’s hard to feel like your small piece of the puzzle is having any impact at all.”</div>

I feel impotent.”</div>

She feels hypocritical when facing people’s expectations of her based on her job.

                        “I had always achieved what I set out to do in my life”, he says, “but when I learned about the climate crisis and tried to apply the same approach, I got nowhere - I felt I couldn’t do anything to help. It broke me”. He explains that this drove him into a deep depression. “Then I learned more of the reality about racism, climate justice, the inequality of everything. And in the process, I learnt how to be a better person, I think”.</div>

                        “I recently challenged students organising a career talk from BP - they prevented me from handing out flyers and told the students not to read them! They tried to have me removed”, he tells me. “They surrounded me, telling me that I’d ruined their event, that all the students want is a career and I was preventing them from having that… I exploded with rage. I was furious. I was so enraged! I had to take an hour off and cried on a friend’s shoulder.” We pause for a minute as I struggle not to cry listening to him. “It’s not helpful when I can’t control my fury. But I’m so angry at politicians and the media, worried they will get fired if they act - so GET FIRED! Journalists should be moral, braver than they are. I’m angry with academics - but although they’re victims of a siloed academic system, they are not so naive not to realise that. Society has always needed people to follow the trend, to keep things 'stable', but this time it will kill us. Joining a group like Scientists for Extinction Rebellion has enabled me to find the change-makers, and it saved my life. The feeling I had before, as though I was alone, was terrifying. I was led to believe I was insane. Now I’ve found my community, I feel settled again.”</div>

I don’t feel like science alone can provide the whole picture nor all the answers. But in my work we aren’t encouraged to look beyond the ‘hard facts’. Involving values and emotions is usually frowned upon in the research world. It makes the work a bit inhumane. So, I detach myself from work and find a way forward via culture and art, and connecting with other human beings. When you do that, you start thinking past yourself. That’s ultimately why we’re facing the problems we are.”</div>

Politicians, they are the real villains here. I want to hold them to account, for justice to be done - I’m not the criminal, they are the ones who are wrong! I have to be brave and to be brave I have to be angry. It’s easier for me to do because the science is so clear.”

I have to maintain my beliefs in the face of everyone else acting as if I’m crazy.” He tells me he feels very lonely, alienated. “It feels like we’ve been abandoned. The systems you think would be there to look after us - they don’t exist. It all seems so bizarre and absurd.”

We’re not only doing harm - there are pockets of people healing, but it’s so overwhelmed by the destruction.” He tells me that it makes it hard to be in the wild places he loves. “I feel hurt everywhere I look. I just wish everyone could feel a connection to nature. Then they would fight as hard as I am.”

I can be so struck by the beauty of walking down the beach, seeing a fish in a pool, a spider's web… but at the same time, I’m terrified that we’re going to lose it all and there’s nothing I can do!

The discussion is tinged with sadness, “it’s not shock, I literally can’t describe it. It’s the most outrageous and nonsensical thing.” He says he feels this deeply as a scientist, “you spend your entire life coming up with answers, and people choose not to use them. We have the answers – we know what to do. But as a society we just don’t do it. We could sort all of it out if we just decided to dedicate adequate resources to it. It’s just completely incomprehensible. It just doesn’t make any sense at all.”

Maybe it’s just there bubbling away all the time… But I don’t think it’s healthy – it’s not helping my resilience at all.

She is deeply aware of our privilege in Europe, and seems appalled that we’re not using it to protect people who can’t protect themselves.

She’s been told there’s no use in being angry, and perhaps this is the cause of her cycling from rage to apathy.

At the same time, the world of research in which she works feels ineffective: “it feels as though it’s just about publishing research articles, but not telling the people who need it, just other researchers”. She tells me she doesn’t see the point of her work, and that anyone could come along and do her job. She seems racked with guilt for having these thoughts: “it feels like we’re not allowed to feel this way”.

Then I feel despondent – like giving up.”

People working in climate change are – to her – amazing scientists who have worked for years trying to bring attention to what climate change is and what it means for the world. “That’s not me! I just write about this stuff!” she says. She tells me that her work sometimes involves arguing that others should live more sustainably, but finds it deeply uncomfortable that she doesn’t live a perfect life herself: “I feel like I embody those values when it’s easy to do so – but who am I to argue with others if that’s the case?”. She confesses to turning away from news about climate change: “It terrifies me – the stuff that we can’t fix – there’s no going back when lives have been lost, or species are extinct”. She explains that she skims the headlines but sometimes can’t face reading the articles in detail: “and that’s part of the problem – that we’re choosing not to see and look the other way because it’s uncomfortable to acknowledge”.

                        She tells me that she feels frustrated reading IPCC reports every few years, seeing scientists loudly and clearly saying this is a crisis because the level of ambition of governments and corporations is so low: “it’s not enough – what makes me frustrated is how far we are from where we need to be!”

                        “Five years ago, I was hopeful that we could still do something about the planet”, she explains, “but now we have so much inequality and inaction. The last five years have made me feel powerless. It feels as though it doesn’t matter what I do – at the end of the day it doesn’t change anything.”</div>

                        She explains that she lives in a constant state of guilt: “it’s always there, no matter what”. She tells me that she tries hard to live sustainably in every part of her life – but there’s always more she could do. “I spend hours checking labels in grocery shops!”. Along with this Western guilt about climate change and sustainability, she tells me she also has survival guilt coming from Iran, “things there are getting much worse”, she says. She also explains that she finds it hard to talk to friends about sustainability: “nobody wants to go grocery shopping with me anymore.”</div>
