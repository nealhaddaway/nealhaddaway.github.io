                          "Hypocritical"

                        “People often think I’m saving the world with my job”, she tells me, “when actually, I’m behind a computer all day”. She feels hypocritical when facing people’s expectations of her based on her job. She also explains that the hypocrisy manifests itself in how she lives her life, not as sustainable as she could: “I get anxiety reading about other people trying their hardest to live well”, but she confesses to not knowing exactly how we can live sustainably, “it’s frustrating.”

                        She tells me that she doesn’t feel helpful anymore, questioning herself. This self-doubt is clearly challenging who she thought she was. “Doctors and nurses can see the impact of their work. With what I do, I really cannot see how I’m helping.”

                        <img src="../assets/img/pics/nhilce3.jpg" style="width: 50%;" alt="" /><br><br>
                        “I feel uninspired”, she confesses, “so how can I help to inspire others?”. She explains that even the young people she talks to through her youth outreach work aren’t as motivated, that just the last 12 months has seen a big drop in their enthusiasm. “If I start to think about it, nothing makes sense.”

                          She tells me that she does feel hope in a way: “My hope is that the kids of my friends start growing up with these ideas of being fair and environmentally conscientious. They see their parents’ behaviour and it sinks in. I have hope on that”.
