                          Katy works in climate change adaptation policy, particularly focused on the cascading effects of climate change from one place to another.

                          "Fickle"

                       She tells me that she feels fickle, flipping between an idealist and a realist view of how best to govern climate change: “Sometimes I feel we should be brave and dare to dream, to believe that climate change can transcend politics, that it can lead us to be better than we are today – more collaborative, more cooperative. Then I flip – no, we can’t be dreamers, we’re more likely to get the changes we’re calling for if they account for the way the world works today”. She tells me that she has different identities on different days of the week.

                          "Fraudulent"

                        <img src="../assets/img/pics/katy2.jpg" style="width: 50%;" alt="" /><br><br>
                        “I feel like a fraud in all sorts of ways”, she confesses. People working in climate change are – to her – amazing scientists who have worked for years trying to bring attention to what climate change is and what it means for the world. “That’s not me! I just write about this stuff!” she says. She tells me that her work sometimes involves arguing that others should live more sustainably, but finds it deeply uncomfortable that she doesn’t live a perfect life herself: “I feel like I embody those values when it’s easy to do so – but who am I to argue with others if that’s the case?”. She confesses to turning away from news about climate change: “It terrifies me – the stuff that we can’t fix – there’s no going back when lives have been lost, or species are extinct”. She explains that she skims the headlines but sometimes can’t face reading the articles in detail: “and that’s part of the problem – that we’re choosing not to see and look the other way because it’s uncomfortable to acknowledge”.
                        </h5><br>
                        <h5 class="text-black-75 mt-5"><i>
                          "Resolute"

                        <img src="../assets/img/pics/katy3.jpg" style="width: 50%;" alt="" /><br><br>
                        Despite all this, she feels resolute: “we just have to keep on going, there’s no other option. Even though it sometimes feels like you’re trying to swim across a vast ocean, you just have to keep swimming”. She tells me, with a shrug, that there’s nothing else to do, because at least it’s something.

                        I ask her if she feels hope: “Yes – hmm…?”, she questions herself, “Yes, I feel hope – I’m not sure I could do this job if I didn’t. But I can’t always articulate what I’m hoping for.”
