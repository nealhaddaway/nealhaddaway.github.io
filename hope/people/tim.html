                       “I’ve made sacrifices, but there’s always more I could do”, he says, explaining his guilt that he doesn’t live as sustainably as he could. He tells me of the pangs of guilt he feels when it comes to food and travel: “since having kids, convenience often takes priority”. There is also the fact of being born into a society responsible for much of the catastrophe we’re currently facing. “This guilt motivates me in a way”, he explains, “it’s my responsibility to be part of the solution. But I always feel like I could dedicate more effort to increasing my knowledge and capacity to drive change”.

                        He describes his sense of dismay and alarm at the unfairness of the effects of environmental crises: “they make life so much harder for people in communities already facing challenges. It’s a perfect storm”. He seems particularly alarmed about poor decisions that entrench vulnerability in places most at risk from climate change. “I’ve seen this combination first-hand working in Vietnam”.

                        He tells me that it’s heartening to see progress with some decision-making – the change in administration in the United States and policy proposals in the European Union, for example. “I’m cautiously hopeful. These things tend to happen in waves”, he explains, referring to unforeseen circumstances that can slow or hasten progress. He tells me that the crises being seen in 2021 have fed more into a feeling of hope than despair: “Public consciousness is dawning and not only among youth, there is also a shift in my parents’ generation”, he says.

                        He tells me he feels hope “because there’s a broader acceptance that we can’t continue the way we are. This is driving support for hard decisions. At the same time, technological progress has consistently exceeded expectations. There are strong signs that things are going in the right direction.”
