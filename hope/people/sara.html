                          Sara is a researcher working in the field of future studies – building scenarios for how the future might look and making decisions under uncertainty.

                          "Frustrated"
                          </i><br><br>

                       She tells me that she feels frustrated reading IPCC reports every few years, seeing scientists loudly and clearly saying this is a crisis because the level of ambition of governments and corporations is so low: “it’s not enough – what makes me frustrated is how far we are from where we need to be!”

                          "Powerless"

                        <img src="../assets/img/pics/sara2.jpg" style="width: 50%;" alt="" /><br><br>
                        “Five years ago, I was hopeful that we could still do something about the planet”, she explains, “but now we have so much inequality and inaction. The last five years have made me feel powerless. It feels as though doesn’t matter what I do – at the end of the day it doesn’t change anything.”
                        </h5><br>

                          "Guilty"
                          </i><br><br>
                        <img src="../assets/img/pics/sara3.jpg" style="width: 50%;" alt="" /><br><br>
                        She explains that she lives in a constant state of guilt: “it’s always there, no matter what”. She tells me that she tries hard to live sustainably in every part of her life – but there’s always more she could do. “I spend hours checking labels in grocery shops!”. Along with this Western guilt about climate change and sustainability, she tells me she also has survival guilt coming from Iran, “things there are getting much worse”, she says. She also explains that she finds it hard to talk to friends about sustainability: “nobody wants to go grocery shopping with me anymore.”

                        <h5 class="text-black-75 mt-5">
                        I ask her if she feels hope: “I don’t feel hopeful now about the future state of the planet. All we can do is our best to control the damage, but things are going to get worse. There are no alternative futures anymore, there is one future and we’re doomed in it.”
