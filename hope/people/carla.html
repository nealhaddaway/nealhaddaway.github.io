                          Carla is a researcher working on the connection between management of watersheds and societal access to water and sanitation.

                          "Outraged"

                        She tells me that she is outraged that we are leaving so many people behind as environmental problems exacerbate, that the world is so unfair: “some of us are in a position to speak and act, but a lot of us aren’t doing anything”. She is deeply aware of our privilege in Europe, and seems appalled that we’re not using it to protect people who can’t protect themselves.

                        <img src="../assets/img/pics/carla2.jpg" style="width: 50%;" alt="" /><br><br>
                        “I feel betrayed by other generations – and now by promises being made that I know can’t be fulfilled”, she tells me. She wonders if there is anything shocking enough to force the people in power to recognise the crisis and act. She feels angry, unheard, put aside. She’s been told there’s no use in being angry, and perhaps this is the cause of her cycling from rage to apathy.
                        </h5><br>
                        <h5 class="text-black-75 mt-5"><i>
                          "Hopeless"

                        The apathy manifests itself as a feeling of hopelessness, “I’ve been robbed of my dreams”, she explains. At the same time, the world of research in which she works feels ineffective: “it feels as though it’s just about publishing research articles, but not telling the people who need it, just other researchers”. She tells me she doesn’t see the point of her work, and that anyone could come along and do her job. She seems racked with guilt for having these thoughts: “it feels like we’re not allowed to feel this way”.

                        <h5 class="text-black-75 mt-5">
                        “No, I don’t feel hope. I don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel”, she confesses. She says we need something bigger – a revolution, perhaps. “But I don’t feel hopeful about the future.”
